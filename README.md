I have now amended the Sound Generator files to make provision for proper ADSR envelopes.  I have also written a small synthesizer that lets you play with the settings.  Put Sound.java, Tone.java, Envelope.java, SoundStyles.css and MiNiSYNTH.png in your source directory and compile Sound.java, to get the synthesizer.  I will be very interested in peoples' comments/suggestions.

There are reasonably detailed comments in the header to the Tone.java file.  Hopefully they'll get you started.

Cheers,


DUNCAN
