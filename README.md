# Silicon-Data

The following files are included in the Silicon Project:
+ Game.java (top-level Java Class);
+ Tone.java (simple threaded sound generator - frequency for milliseconds, and volume if you must)
+ Game.css (JavaFX .css file with button, and other, styles);
+ Silicon-logo.png (logo for the Game Board); and
+ iconic-photographs-1940-first-computer.jpg (first decade/era background for the Game Board).

To compile the Game.java and Tone.java files, put the Game.css file in the same directory as the .java files, and the Silicon-logo.png and iconic-(etc.)-computer.jpg files in a bin\images directory.
