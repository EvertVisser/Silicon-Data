I have now amended the Sound Generator files to make provision for proper ADSR envelopes.  I have also written a small synthesizer that lets you play with the settings, as well as .mp3 and .wav audio files.

I still haven't quite worked out where Eclipse expects all the files to be for compilation, but I have had some success by putting the .java and .css files in the /src directory, and a copy of the .mp3 and .png files in four places: the project (/Sound) directory, the /src directory, the /bin directory, and a specific /resources directory on the same level as /src and /bin.  I will be very interested in peoples' comments/suggestions.

There are reasonably detailed comments in the header to the Tone.java file.  Hopefully they'll get you started.

Cheers,


DUNCAN
