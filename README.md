# Silicon-Data

The following files are included in the Silicon Project:
+ Game.java (top-level Java Class);
+ Sound.java (simple sound generator - frequency for milliseconds, and volume if you must)
+ Game.css (JavaFX .css file with button, and other, styles); and
+ iconic-photographs-1940-first-computer.jpg (first decade/era background for the Game Board).

To compile the Game.java and Sound.java files, put the Game.css file in the same directory as the .java files, and the iconic-(etc.)-computer.jpg file in a bin\images directory.
