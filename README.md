# Silicon-Data

The following files are included in the Silicon Project:
+ Game.java (top-level Java Class);
+ Game.css (JavaFX .css file with button, and other, styles); and
+ iconic-photographs-1940-first-computer.jpg (background for the main menu).

To compile the Game.java file, put the Game.css and iconic (etc.) files in the same directory.
